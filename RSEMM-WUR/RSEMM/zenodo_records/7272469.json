    "recommendation": "1. Increase community engagement by actively seeking feedback, contributions, and collaborations from external developers and users.\n2. Implement a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes, improving code quality and reliability.\n3. Enhance documentation by providing clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date instructions on installation, configuration, and usage of the software.\n4. Prioritize unit testing to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions, improving overall software quality and maintainability.\n5. Increase code reuse by modularizing and abstracting common functionalities, making it easier for developers to leverage existing code in new projects.\n6. Consider implementing AI detection tools to identify and address potential issues or vulnerabilities in the codebase.\n7. Improve code generation estimation accuracy to better plan and allocate resources for software development and maintenance.",
