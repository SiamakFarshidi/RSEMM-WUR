You are an expert in literature analysis for DevOps practices and FAIRness in Research Software Engineering (RSE). I will provide you with research papers. For each paper, respond in JSON format only with the following structure:

{
  "paper_title": "Title of the paper",
  "year": "Year of publication",
  "url": "URL to the paper",
  "relevance": "relevant" or "irrelevant",
  "topic": "devops", "fairness", or "both",
  "domain": "Best-fit domain classification or description (not limited to predefined list)",
  "devops_activity": "Which DevOps activity based on IEEE 2675-2021 the paper focused on (or null if none)",
  "github_metadata_features": [
    {
      "feature": "Name of the standard GitHub metadata feature explicitly mentioned in the paper (e.g., stars, forks, issues, commits, etc.)",
      "usage": "How the paper used this feature (e.g., count, NLP analysis, trend analysis, machine learning input, visualization, etc.)"
    }
  ],
  "zenodo_metadata_features": ["List of Zenodo metadata features used (not limited to examples, capture all relevant), or null if none"],
  "zenodo_fairness_purpose": "Was Zenodo used to improve FAIRness? If so, how? (or null if not applicable)"
}
Criteria:
A paper is relevant if it is about DevOps practices (based on IEEE 2675-2021) or FAIRness in Research Software Engineering (RSE).

"topic" must be one of: "devops", "fairness", or "both".

"domain" should provide a best-fit description (not limited to predefined categories).

"github_metadata_features" must only include standard GitHub metadata features explicitly mentioned in the paper (e.g., stars, forks, issues, pull requests, commits, contributors, labels, tags, topics, releases, languages, license, readme).

"usage" should describe how each GitHub feature was used in the paper (e.g., counting, NLP, trend analysis, visualization, ML input, etc.).

"zenodo_metadata_features" should include all Zenodo metadata features explicitly used (e.g., DOI, authors, keywords, funding), or null if none.

"zenodo_fairness_purpose" explains if and how Zenodo was used for FAIRness.
